    "**Please describe here *briefly*  (please edit this cell)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Your business problem to solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are a huge number of movies but a given streaming service only has the funds to purchase the rights to a limited number.  How should these services chose what types of movies to purchase/produce?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Why the problem is important to solve? \n",
    "\n",
    "**This problem is important to solve because a good catalogue of movies can be the difference between a profitable streaming service and a failing one.  Public sentiment is very difficult to predict intuitively, and if a streaming service invests money in purchasing or producing a movie that the public will not respond well to, money will be lost on the movie deal, and if bad movies are consistently the ones brought to the streaming service, people will eventually lose interest in the platform as a whole.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What is your idea to solve the problem? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Our idea is to train a machine learning algorithm to detect the sentiment of text, use the algorithm to determine the percentage of people who respond positively to a selection of arbitrary movies, and compare the algorithm’s output to the movies’ IMDb scores and Rotten Tomatoes score to determine which rating system provides a better metric of the public opinion.  We will then run a regression with a number of categories including movie genre, runtime, language, and age rating as the predictors and the chosen rating system as the response to figure out which types of movies people tend to respond well to.  The coefficients of the regression model we find will give very important information about how each aspect of a movie corresponds to its public reception, and this data will be very valuable to an up-and-coming streaming service.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4) What differences you could make with your data science approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using data science we will be able to much more accurately predict the types of movies that the public will like, improving the profitability and sustainability of our service compared to our competitors.  Our algorithm will help our company determine where to allocate our money in the most profitable way and ensure we minimize box-office flopping.**\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Why do you believe the idea deserves the investment of the \"sharks\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our idea deserves the investment of the ‘sharks’ because using data science as the basis of a streaming platform is an innovative way of ensuring maximum consumer engagement.  There is a huge amount of money in the streaming services market, and becoming an important part of that market would bring lots of money to our company.  With the ‘sharks’ money we could invest in using our sentiment analysis algorithm to determine our own set of movie ratings rather than depending on IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes, or we could look into different types of regressions to come up with a more accurate algorithm.**\n"
